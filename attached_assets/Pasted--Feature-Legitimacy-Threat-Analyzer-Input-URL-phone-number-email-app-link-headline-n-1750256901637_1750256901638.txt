| 💬 Text Credibility & Risk | OpenAI (GPT-4), Claude, or LLama2/3 to analyze grammar, intent, tone, misinformation |
| 📱 Phone Number Legitimacy | NumVerify API → Link
Twilio Lookup API → carrier, region, type info |
| 📦 App & APK Analysis | MobSF (Mobile Security Framework) → for app reverse analysis & metadata validation |
| 🧠 Social/Web Tracing (Emails) | EmailRep API → Checks if email is spammy, linked to breaches

📊 Output: What You Can Show in Your Report
Each input (URL, app, number, etc.) should generate a report like:

✅ Example: URL Report
Input: http://bitly.io/abc123

Legitimacy Score: 2.5/10 (Phishing Link)

🛠️ Building It – Stack Suggestion
Feature	Suggested Stack
Frontend	Gradio / React
Backend	FastAPI / Flask
NLP Models	HuggingFace Transformers (for fake news)
URL Safety	Google Safe Browsing API, VirusTotal
Phone Check	NumVerify, Twilio
App Check	MobSF on server
News Analysis	GPT-4 or fine-tuned BERT
LLM Summary	GPT-4o, Claude, or your own LLaMA3 model

🚀 Bonus: Auto Decision + Trust Score
You can compute a Trust Score (0–10):

python
Copy
Edit
trust_score = (URL_score + text_score + phone_validity + model_confidence) / 4
Then:

9–10: ✅ Safe

6–8: ⚠️ Low Risk

3–5: ❌ Suspicious

0–2: 🚫 Dangerous/Fake
