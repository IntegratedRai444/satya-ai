"You are now acting as an elite AI architect and cybersecurity engineer. Your task is to help build a fully advanced, stealth-based, AI-powered cybersecurity SaaS company called SatyaSec. This system protects startups using transformers, vision/audio models, penetration simulation, and adaptive agents—all while hiding the AI nature from clients. Begin the full development cycle based on this outline. Follow stealth rules: hide AI labels, obfuscate LLM usage, and label modules as analytics or simulation tools. Provide step-by-step guidance, code, deployment strategies, and agent creation flows. Here's the breakdown:"

1. System Architecture Goals
Build modular services using FastAPI and Next.js.

All models (CLIP, SAM, DeBERTa, Whisper, etc.) must be served stealthily using obfuscated inference pipelines.

Use VLLM and Transformers for model serving and disguise outputs using rule-based mimicry.

Create core modules:

Sentinel Engine (TFT-based detection)

Forensics Suite (CLIP, SAM, DINO)

PenSim Simulator (GPT-based red teaming)

Messaging Filter (Transformer NLP)

Endpoint Guardian (Rust+WASM)

Incident Assistant (LLM bot disguised as a dashboard wizard)

2. Founder Portal: SatyaX
Create a hidden admin panel with:

Agent Generator

Red Team Launcher

AutoPatch Trigger

Vault Log Explorer

Secure prompt execution for fine-tuning and cloning

Build secure prompt endpoints like:

create_agent(name, role, model, visibility)

assign_agent(agent_id, client_id, mode)

simulate_attack(client_id, vector)

summarize_logs(client_id, range)

trigger_autopatch(client_id)

3. Frontend Requirements
Use TailwindCSS + ShadCN for sleek design.

Dashboard should not reveal AI or model names.

Use charts via Recharts, tokenized logs via tRPC, and React state for module toggles.

Interface should mimic enterprise-grade SIEM or analytics tools.

4. Backend & Agent Orchestration
Backend in FastAPI

Deploy AI models through hidden VLLM containers

Create Dockerized stealth agents with microservice control

Use Redis for session state and PostgreSQL for logs/metrics

Connect Kafka streams for real-time detection + agent sync

5. Security Layer
Use OAuth2 + RBAC for external login

Founder panel: secured by mTLS and TPM key binding

JWTs with dynamic key rotation

Obfuscate all LLM endpoints using proxy-based routing

6. Model Usage
HuggingFace transformers:

DeBERTa for anomaly logs

Whisper + Wav2Vec2 for audio forgery

CLIP + SAM + DINOv2 for media forensics

TFT or Informer for time series attack prediction

All model outputs converted into logs, not raw text

Label reports as “correlated insights” or “heuristic models”

7. Deployment
Containerize each microservice

Kubernetes with hidden namespaces for agent deployments

GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Use LangServe for transformer pipelines

8. Founder Automation
Add voice CLI for SatyaX portal using Whisper

Build Gradio CLI-style terminal for SatyaX with password vault

Store logs in encrypted S3 bucket behind VPC

SatyaX should offer the following secret commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
create_agent("ForensicEye", "vision_forensics", "CLIP+SAM", "hidden")
simulate_attack("startup42", "phishing+malware")
generate_compliance_report("client123", "SOC2")
clone_agent("DarkSentinel", "sandbox")
purge_agent_logs("agent707")
9. Compliance & Reports
Auto-generate templates for SOC2, GDPR, ISO27001

Use GPT-based templating engine, but replace LLM logs with technical summaries

Charts in reports must be stylized using SVG renderers

10. Post-MVP Scaling
Add Zero Trust Agent Mesh (ZTAM)

Launch SatyaSecHub (plugin system)

Enable offline mode with self-hosted agent bundles

Create stealth honeypot & log faker module
